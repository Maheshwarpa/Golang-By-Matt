Functions are one type where the order of the input parameters that we pass matters.

We do have things which can be referred as pass by value or pass by reference


Arrays,numbers,struct,boolean and other datatypes are pass by value
Slice, Map,channels,strings are pass by reference

when passed the maps as a avalue its underlying things are been mapped to an hash table. When updating the elements it gets updated in the original one as well.
But when you try to re initialize it, then it turns or maps into another hashtable so further modifyication to it doesnt change the things to the original.


Defer function executes once the surrounding function completes. It follows the LIFO.
